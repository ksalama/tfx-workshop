# Machine Learning with TensorFlow Extended

The puprpose of these labs is to show how to do end-to-end ML with TFX libraries. The labs tutorial covers:

1. Data analysis and shcema generation with **TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)**.
2. Data preprcessing with **TensorFlow Transform (TFT) **.
3. Model training and evaluation with **TensorFlow Estimator API**.
4. Model validation with **Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA)**.

In these labs, we use the UCI Adult Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.
The task is to predict whether income exceeds 50K USD per year based on census data. The dataset is also known as "Census Income".
